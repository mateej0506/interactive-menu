Frontend project that lets you add or remove the wanted drink, or view their description when added.
To run, open index.html in your browser.
To interact with the project, type in the drink you want to add to the "menu", and to submit, press Submit or the "enter" button. If the drink's description was written beforehand, it will pop up next to the drink's name, and if not, the appropriate message will show.
The website blocks the user from trying to submit an empty text.
If needed, you can remove the drink manually by pressing the remove button("x") in the top right corner of the drink's box, or remove all drinks by pressing "Remove All".
The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
